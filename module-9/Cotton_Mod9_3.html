<h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

<p>
    Some of my favorite movie moments are the ones with jets screaming across the sky,  
    especially the scenes with the F‑14 Tomcat launching off a carrier deck. The mix  
    of engine noise, radio chatter, and dramatic music makes everything feel larger  
    than life, like the whole world is holding its breath for that one  
    <span id="word1">______</span> takeoff.
</p>

<p>
    Watching those scenes is a big part of why I enjoy building aircraft in Blender.  
    Trying to model an F‑14 means paying attention to every curve, panel line, and  
    moving part. It’s not always easy, but there’s something satisfying about  
    tweaking the mesh, adjusting the lighting, and finally getting a render that  
    looks <span id="word2">______</span> on screen.
</p>

<p>
    Blender feels a bit like directing my own movie. I can set the camera angle,  
    line up the shot, and imagine the jet roaring past just like in the films  
    that got me hooked in the first place. Every new project teaches me something  
    different, and each finished model feels like one more step toward creating  
    the kind of <span id="word3">______</span> scenes I grew up loving and the  
    <span id="word4">______</span> I want to build in the future.
